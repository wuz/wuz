# README

## Howdy

Hello there! I'm Conlin (but some folks call me Wuz). I am engineering manager
and software engineer working to [demystify compensation](https://getagora.com).
I'm fascinated by the intersection of art, community and technology.

I have about 1000 hobbies and I'm always excited to learn new things.
This README is my personal "documenation", a way for you to get to know what
I care about and where my focuses lie.

## About Me

### Personal Principles

**Be a prism, not a mirror**. Seek to digest and break apart information,
not just pass it on to someone else.

**Optimize for consensus**. Reject: kings, presidents, and voting.
Believe in: rough consensus and exploratory tests.

**Mistakes are how we learn**. Failure is an opportunity to learn something new.

Alright, let's do this one more time. My name is Conlin Durbin and for the past 11-ish
years I've been writing and thinking about code. I started programming in high school,
building Wordpress websites and creating custom plugins in PHP.

I went to college, studied Computer Science, hated it. I switched
majors to Economics and did software development on the side and fell
in love with the range of subjects that let me study.

I started a company in college, turned it into a consultancy and eventually ended
it when my business partner graduated. I helped grow and build a coworking space in
an old church and met some awesome people.

After college, I started working at a software company called Mimir in West Lafayette,
building an application for compiling, running, and grading programming homework
for college computer science classes. I jumped to Lessonly after that, worked on
a ton of different products initiatives there - all focused around helping people
learn and grow in their jobs. I left that job and spent a little over a year at
HackerRank, which was... a good learning opportunity. After a bunch of experiences
that pushed me out of that job, I left and started looking for a new gig! I
found out about Agora and loved the mission and the people. 
I joined the team in July 2021 and have been loving it here!

I live in Indianapolis, Indiana with my partner Annadele and our two dogs and cats.
It's a pretty hectic household at times, but we love it. I love cooking and I love
playing tabletop RPG's like Dungeons and Dragons. I even play weekly in a 
live-stream called Sunset over Vengalia.

### Life by the Accidents

> You learn about life by the accidents you have, over and over again

- Kurt Vonnegut

Now that we're caught up, I'll explain a bit about myself today! Most of my life
has been spent jumping from interest to interest, finding the things I like.
Life by the accidents, if you will. I love learning new things and I have a
ton of hobbies that include but are not limited to (in no particular order):

1. Films and TV
2. Reading (both fiction and non-fiction)
3. Making fermented foods
4. Biking, coffee, and other hipster pursuits
5. Video Games
6. Cooking
7. Listening to and playing music
8. Talking about any of the above things for _hours_

I was recently diagnosed with ADHD, which has really helped me get a handle on
the way my brain works (and explains a lot about my hobby predilections).

> Technology is the active human interface with the material world.

- Ursula Le Guin

I spend a lot of my free time thinking and writing about technology and hacking
on side projects. Most of my side projects these days are focused on Dungeons
and Dragons.

Hopefully, this gives you a bit of an idea of who I am! Come chat with me,
message me about grabbing a coffee, or just flag me down on Slack!
I am always interested in chatting and getting to know more about people.

The next section includes some information about my typical week and how
I like to work. If you work closely with me, it might give you some more
insight into what my job looks like and how I approach it. Feel free to
skip it if you don't need to know that information!

### How I Like to Work

My main task in every week is staying on top of any development that needs to
be done. I also like to make sure I have time for mentoring and pairing with
other developers (if you ever want to pair, I'd love to do that!). I use Google
Calendar to time block out my work, which helps me focus on the most important
things. I use Calendly to schedule coffee chats and other small meetings.

What this means is that I spend a good amount of my time in periods of Deep Work
(or at least trying to) split up as minimally as possible by meetings around design,
feature planning, 1-1 with my manager, and pairing sessions. I used to recommend
reading the Maker/Manager Schedule, but Paul G is pretty terrible. I plan to write
up a bit about this soon.

In an attempt to focus deeply, I sometimes don't immediately respond to Slack.
During Deep Work time, I turn on Do Not Disturb on Slack and close my email apps.
If you need to get a hold of me urgently, I'd recommend forcing Slack to send a
message through the Do Not Disturb settings, but **please only do this if it's
urgent**. After a deep working session, I check all my notifications - Slack,
email, Github, ticket tracking, etc.
