# About Me

### Heya folks, pleased to meet you!

I'm Conlin (but some people [call me Wuz](https://twitter.com/CallMeWuz). I'm a frontend engineer, with a big interest in the intersection of art, community, and technology.

I have about 1000 hobbies and I am always excited to learn new things! There are a couple of sections here about me in the past, some about me right now, and then a few about my future. Plus at the end, I've included some information about how I like to work and what my average week looks like!

# How I got here

## [Let's do this one more time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-dAO5OenO8)

Alright, let's do this one more time. My name is Conlin Durbin and for the past 11-ish years, I've been writing code. I was born in Indiana. I grew up in a town called Greensburg. In high school I did a lot - I was on the swim team, drama club, show choir, speech team, academic team, and I worked at my local library. While I was working there I got my first job writing code, started to learn PHP/Wordpress development and never looked back!

After that, I went to college, studied Computer Science, hated it. I switched majors to Economics and did software development on the side and really fell in love with the range of subjects that let me study.

I started a startup, turned it into a consultancy, and then killed it when my business partner graduated. I worked in a bunch of different consulting gigs while in college, building all sorts of software, for all kinds of industries (One was a tool to help farmers track when their neighbors were spraying their crops.)

I helped grow and build the Anvil coworking space at Purdue and was an early founding member of the co-ed entrepreneurship fraternity there.

After college, I started working at a software company called Mimir in West Lafayette, building an application for compiling, running, and grading programming homework for college computer science classes. I jumped to Lessonly after that, worked on a ton of different products initiatives there - all focused around helping people learn and grow in their jobs. I left that job and spent a little over a year at HackerRank, which was... an experience. After a bunch of things happening that pushed me out of that job, I left and started looking for a new gig! I found out about Figure and loved the mission and the people. I joined the team in July 2021 and have been loving it here!

## Life by the Accidents

> You learn about life by the accidents you have, over and over again

- Kurt Vonnegut

Now that we are caught up, I'll explain a bit about myself today! Most of my life has been spent jumping from interest to interest, finding the things I like. Life by the accidents, if you will.I am really into learning new things and I have a ton of hobbies that include but are not limited to (in no particular order):

1. Films and TV
2. Reading (both fiction and non-fiction)
3. Making fermented foods
4. Biking, coffee, and other hipster pursuits
5. Video Games
6. Cooking
7. Listening to and playing music
8. Talking about any of the above things for _hours_

> Technology is the active human interface with the material world.

- Ursula Le Guin

I spend a lot of my free time thinking and writing about technology and hacking on side projects. At work, I spend most of my time planning architecture, working on the frontend, and helping other engineers push their work forward.

## The Future

In my personal life, I plan to keep living in Irvington. My partner finished vet school in 2020 and moved here with me. I hope to help make Indianapolis a great place for all kinds of folks. I'll continue to focus on the intersection of art, technology, and community as a way to create better places for everyone!

I frequently pick up new hobbies, but some that I am interested in include gardening, home repair, and bike maintenance.

Professionally, I want to keep writing and producing technical content while also focusing myself towards a more engineering management/developer advocacy position. I love working with people and really want to continue growing my community.

Hopefully, this gives you a bit of an idea of who I am! Come chat with me, message me about grabbing a coffee, or just flag me down at lunchtime! I am always interested in chatting and getting to know more about people.

The next section includes some information about my typical week and how I like to work. If you work closely with me, it might give you some more insight into what my job looks like and how I approach it. Feel free to skip it if you don't need to know that information!

## How I Like to Work

My main task in every week is staying on top of any development that needs to be done. I also like to make sure I have time for mentoring and pairing with other developers (if you ever want to pair, I'd love to do that!). I use Google Calendar to time block out my work, which helps me focus on the most important things. I use Calendly to schedule coffee chats and other small meetings

What this means is that I spend a good amount of my time in periods of Deep Work (or at least trying to) split up as minimally as possible by meetings around design, feature planning, 1-1 with my manager, and pairing sessions. I used to recommend reading the Maker/Manager Schedule, but Paul G is pretty terrible. I plan to write up a bit about this soon.

In an attempt to focus deeply, I sometimes don't immediately respond to Slack. During Deep Work time, I turn on Do Not Disturb on Slack and close my email apps. If you need to get a hold of me urgently, I'd recommend forcing Slack to send a message through the Do Not Disturb settings, but **please only do this if it is really urgent**. After a deep working session, I check all my notifications - Slack, email, Github, ticket tracking, etc.
